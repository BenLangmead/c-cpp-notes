# Lifetime & scope

Variable's *lifetime* is the period when it exists in memory

* When lifetime ends, memory is reclaimed and can be reused for other variables

Variable's *scope* is the part of the program where you can use it 

* Lifetime and scope are *often* the same *but not always*

# Lifetime & scope

Scope and lifetime of a variable declared in a block `{`...`}` ends at terminal brace `}`

```c
    if(a == 7) {
        int c = 70;
        printf("%d\n", c);
    }
```

When program reaches `}`, `c` is both *out of scope* (we can't refer to it anymore) and *dead* (memory reclaimed) 

# Lifetime & scope

For `for` loop index variable, scope is the loop body 

```c
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    // after }, i is "dead" and "out of scope"
```

# Lifetime & scope

Variables in scope at the time of a function call are *not* in scope in the callee

\footnotesize

<!---cppmd-file scope1.c
#include <stdio.h>

void print_a() {
    // COMPILER ERROR; can't refer to 'a' here
    printf("a=%d\n", a);
}

int main() {
    int a = 1; // 'a' declared here
    print_a();
    return 0;
}

# Lifetime & scope

Pointers give a way around this:

\footnotesize

<!---cppmd-file scope2.c
#include <stdio.h>

void print_a(int *a) {
    printf("*a=%d\n", *a); // OK
}

int main() {
    int a = 1; // a declared here
    print_a(&a);
    return 0;
}

gcc -o %PREVBASE% %PREV% -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra
